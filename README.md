# TREE_SEARCH
Tree search methods for RL


### First, do simple Minimax, out to a specific branching factor.

### Then, figure out how to do MCTS....

### I also want to be able to pass in something that gives me the reward from 
the input vector. Because for either search, you need a way to estimate the reward from a transition.
